- Not include any other file or folder that those needed for the project. For archiving this you can include a .gitignore file with the files you want git to ignore. - Add the link to your MyST site to the repo (preferably in the 'About' section of your repo on GitHub). - Complete the ai_documentation.txt file with descriptions of how you used AI tools for this assignment, and any prompts and output.   how d i check this with terminalTo verify each item using the terminal:

Check that only required files and folders are present

ls -a


Review the output to confirm that only project files plus .gitignore are included.

Verify that .gitignore is in the repo and being tracked

cat .gitignore
git status


Check that your MyST site link is added to the GitHub repo
This cannot be checked directly in the terminal because it lives in the GitHub interface. You can confirm the remote URL to ensure you are on the right repo:

git remote -v


Then open the repo in a browser:

gh repo view --web


(Requires GitHub CLI.)

Confirm that ai_documentation.txt exists and is populated

ls
cat ai_documentation.txt


Stage and commit everything once verified

git add .
git commit -m "Finalize project structure and documentation"
git push


If you want checks for something more specific, describe your directory layout.
